# TextFrameWork-using-NLP

  This notebook contains code examples to get started with Natural Language Processing in Python with the help of various modules of NLTK and Spacy.
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is defined as the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech.

**Natural Language Tool Ki(NLTK)**

  NLTK is one of the significant libraries used in natural language processing and is also widely popular among researchers and developers. Various tools are used by NLTK to process the text and mine the information needed. there are a lot of unwanted characters such as puncuations, newlines which we need to deal with before heading into further analysis.
  
**Spacy**

  spaCy by explosion.ai is a library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python and Cython. spaCy comes with pre-trained statistical models and word vectors, and currently supports tokenization for 20+ languages. It features the fastest syntactic parser in the world, convolutional neural network models for tagging, parsing and named entity recognition and easy deep learning integration. It’s commercial open-source software, released under the MIT licence.
  
**Methods used for processing the text using NLTK and SpaCy**

1) Tokenization: Segmenting text into words, punctuations marks etc.
2) Stemming: Stemming is a rudimentary rule-based process of stripping the suffixes (“ing”, “ly”, “es”, “s” etc) from a word.
3) Lemmatization: Lemmatization, on the other hand, is an organized & step by step procedure of obtaining the root form of the word, it makes
4) Named Entity Recognition (NER): Labelling named “real-world” objects, like persons, companies or locations.
5) Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging: Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning grammatical properties (e.g. noun, verb, adverb, adjective etc.) to words.
6) Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching                  and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.
